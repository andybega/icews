# icews 0.1.0

This is the initial package version with minimal functionality for what *I* need. Mileage might vary. 

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Added download functinality that will keep a local copy of the ICEWS event TSV files synchronized with dataverse, including updating outdated files.
* Added basic database functionality that will create a database containing downloaded events; will synchronize events so that they always reflect the latest version on DVN; however still relies on local copies of the raw files.
