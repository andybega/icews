# icews 0.1.0

This is the initial package version with minimal functionality for what *I* need. Mileage might vary. 

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Added download functinality that will keep a local copy of the ICEWS event TSV files synchronized with dataverse, including updating outdated files.
* Added basic database functionality that will create a database containing downloaded events; however, this does not correctly sync/update events yet, and also cannot work without keeping copies of the raw data files.
